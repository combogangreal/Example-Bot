# Example-Bot
A example discord.py bot with my preferred structure

# Prerequisites
[Python 311](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3116/): Anything above python 3.11 or lower than 3.8 doesn't work with current discord.py, download one of those version

[Discord Bot](https://discord.com/developers/applications): Must know how to get the bots token, and grabbing the user id of yourself, and the id of your support / test server

# Running
1. Run ```pip install -r requirements.txt``` or ```python -m pip install -r requirements.txt```
2. Drag the example.env file into the bot folder, delete the example (make sure the name is just .env), then fill in the values.
3. Run ```python launcher.py``` or ```python3 launcher.py```

# Why
This is a example on how i personally structure all of my discord bots for better organization, and ease of adding features.
